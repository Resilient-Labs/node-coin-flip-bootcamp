Node Coin Flip Game
### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules. Use http to create the server and fs to read your html file. Include vanilla ES6 js in a script tag at the bottom of your html file. 

This coin flip game was inspired upon the hit cartoon "The Flintstones"! Feel free to download this code for your own amusement! You must install npm packages and node in order to run the server on your own localhost! I hope you enjoy trying to beat Barney in this vanilla coded version of a coin flip game!

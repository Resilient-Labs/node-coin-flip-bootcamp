# Coin Flip Web App
This project is a simple coin flipping web application. The user will have 2 options, heads or tails. The user will be able to click on one or the other and as the result will be randomized. If the user chooses heads, it web app will either say heads or tails. If the user won, the result will match what the user chose. If the user lost, the result will NOT match what the user chose.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

I used HTML to add a section for and image of a coin (heads and tails). Next I added 2 buttons for heads or tails. Lastly I added a simple p tag for the result of the web app.

I used CSS to add a simple background image and centered all of the content from the HTML file. Next I changed the color of the font to white so it stands out to the user. 

I used JavaScript to create variables for the result, buttons, and the image of the coin. I added an event listener to each button. In JavaScript, compares the result with what the user picks so it will respond with a random output (heads or tails) and will display the image corresponding to the result.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to add a switch case to the sever.js file.

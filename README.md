# ðŸ’¸  Project: Node Coin Flip Game

This is my Coin Flip project, a cool web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's my first project to see how backend works! I was also able to play around with web api's so that was extremly interesting.

## How It's Made

I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with my favorite front-end framework to create this project. This project was made using Node.js, exploring Web api's & modifying to send request to the server side so that user's couldnt manipulate the source code.

## Lessons Learned

I learned alot about how backend functions off this project & was excited to see how client & server side comminuicate!

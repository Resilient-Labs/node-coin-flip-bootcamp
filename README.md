# Fancy Coin Flipper

![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/4sT1sy4/coinFlip.png)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

This is a simple coinflipper application created to help me start off with my node server skills. I used the http, fs, and url modules to get it working. Besides node I put together a simple interface with html and css, and client side javascript which I served from within my server.

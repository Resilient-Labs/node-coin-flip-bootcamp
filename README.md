# Toss that Coin - Game

A web application that uses HTML for content, CSS to style, Javascript for client side and Node.Js for server side to allow a user to get a randomized result for each coin flip.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, API

I focused on setting up the fetch in our main.js and making sure the conditionals worked correctly. It was an amazing team effort! I learned about the fs and http modules. Http created the server and fs read the html file. 

<!-- ## Optimizations

An array could be used as we learned more about those and objects. Will be looking to add and optimize this code in the future. -->

## Reflections:

I'd like to add animation in the future to show the coin flip. It was really nice to see how we could turn this into a server-side app. My team and I worked well together to work through this project.

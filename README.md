# ðŸ’¸ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Node Coin Flip Game

### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules. Use http to create the server and fs to read your html file. Include vanilla ES6 js in a script tag at the bottom of your html file. Try creating a coin flip guessing game

This is my simple Coin Flip project! Users can click on either the "Heads" or "Tails" button to pick a coin face and then the app will randomly generate a coin face to compare against your choice. Good luck!

# ðŸ’¸ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Node Coin Flip Game

### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules. Use http to create the server and fs to read your html file. Include vanilla ES6 js in a script tag at the bottom of your html file. Try creating a coin flip guessing game

### Process:

<ol>
  <li>Not too bad, actually.  I liked it.</li>
  <li>It was as simple as doing the math in anothe place that's not the main.js and pulling that value from the server.js and have it read as whatever I wanted.</li>
  <li>In this case, I had the server-side JS create a random number from a range--if the number was in the upper range, heads, lower, tails.</li>
   <li>I created an API that create a JSON object with the data type "name" based on where it fell in the range.</li>
  <li>After grabbing that value from the server using a fetch method, I ran that server choice against the user choice using two buttons for 'heads' or 'tails' on the client side.</li>
  <li>HTML and CSS were my classic design staples--a black background with white text and a dashed boxed with a border color, so it's not even worth getting into, really.<li>
  <li>The rest is history.  Easy as pie.</li> 

<p>Overall, It's simple.  It works.  It just satisfied the needs of the project.  I'm happy</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>Completed.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 5 <em>The set up was actually pretty solid and I impressed myself because JavaScript has had me in a full nelson this entire time, but we out here.</em></li>
</ul>

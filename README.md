# coin-flip

This is a kawaii-themed, coin flip generator. The player guesses 'Narwhal' or 'Octopus'. After they choose, the coin (or in this version--the mushroom) will flip. The coin will land on 'Narwhal' or 'Octopus'.

### How It's Made:

The results of the coin (or in this version--the mushroom) flip is determine using the Math.random() method. 'Narwhal' and 'Octopus' both have a 50% chance of being landed on. 


### Lesson Learned

I learned how to use the 'setTimeout' method to delay the evaluation of an expression. In this application, I delayed the rendering of the results to the DOM, until the coin/mushroom flip had finished.

# Flip the Coin

## Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules. Use http to create the server and fs to read your html file. Try creating a coin flip guessing game

### How it's made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js

Created a simple fullstack coin flipping app implementing small things I learned. I did most of my logical code on node.js and the rest of the d\code on javascript.

### Lessons learned:

Another practice of applying logic on server side of the coding.

# ðŸ’¸ Project: Node Coin Flip Game

### What I did to build this app: 
I used mainly Javascript, Node.js, and JSON to make this project.
I essentially set up two random number conditionals on the back end using node that would present 'heads wins' or 'tails wins' using the JSON object presented on my page. I then extracted that result based on the random number conditional that was satisfied and printed that result to the DOM to show the user. 


### Lessons learned:
*JavaScript backend and frontend are similar in appearance but function very differently
*JSON formatting became a little more familiar to me as well. 
*JSON.stringify() converts JS value to JSON string format

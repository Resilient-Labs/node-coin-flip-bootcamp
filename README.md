## How It's Made:

Languages/frameworks use: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

## Thoughts:

I believe this was one of the only projects for this week for us to make work with Node. I will say - we were a bit stuck on this one for a while. It was our first time working with Node! We were able to ask a mentor for help, and sort of figure out a way to make it work on a server. Pretty neat!

# ðŸ’¸ Week 08 Project: Node Coin Flip Game

Live Code: 

# How It's Made:
### Tech used: 
HTML, CSS, JS, and Node. Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules. Use http to create the server and fs to read your html file. Include vanilla ES6 js in a script tag at the bottom of your html file. Try creating a coin flip guessing game.

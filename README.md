# ðŸ’¸ Week08 Bootcamp2019a Project: Node Coin Flip Game

### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules. Use http to create the server and fs to read your html file. Include vanilla ES6 js in a script tag at the bottom of your html file. Try creating a coin flip guessing game

A web application that uses HTML for content, CSS to style, Javascript for client side and Node.Js for server side to allow a user to select Heads or Tails and get a randomized result(winner) for each coin flip. I'd like to add animation in the future to show the coin flip.

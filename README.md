## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

This projects uses the fs and http modules to create a simple server and store the game logic server side.

I optimized this app creating an API parameter to hold the user choice for easier outcome comparison. Additionally, I animated the coin flip to improve the user experience.


## Lessons Learned:
This game was a lot of fun to create. It was my first experience creating a simple server to store game logic on the backend. It drew upon my previous experience using APIs and objects to target the game evaluation logic. I used this game as an opportunity to experiment with animation and feel it added significantly to the experience of playing this coin flip game.

#  üíª Node-Served Project: ü§ë‚ùìCoin Flip Game

![Preview](/img/preview.png)

### Goal:

- Create a simple web application that uses the **fs** and **http** *core node modules*. I created a coin flip guessing game~! The **http** core module was used to create the server and **fs** core module to read the html file. The game was written in vanilla ES6 js in a script tag at the bottom of the html file.

### Tips:

- Install Node https://nodejs.org/
- To run local server, use terminal to navigate to directory containing files
- Type "node node.js"
- In Browser, enter URL: "localhost:8080"
- In this example, the JS for the game logic was run inline with the HTML. In future projects, the node server will render the JS game logic in the back-end, while a separate JS file will handle DOM (document object model) manipulation.

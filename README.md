#  💻 Node-Served Project: 🤑❓Coin Flip Game

![Preview](/img/preview.png)

### Goal:

- Create a simple web application that uses the **fs** and **http** *core node modules*. I created a coin flip guessing game~! The **http** core module was used to create the server and **fs** core module to read the html file. The game was written in vanilla ES6 js in a script tag at the bottom of the html file.

### Goal: Create a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules. Use http to create the server and fs to read your html file. Include vanilla ES6 js in a script tag at the bottom of your html file.

### How It's Made
I used HTML and CSS+Flexbox to style, structure and position. I also utilized JavaScript and Node.js to create the functions that would randomize the winner of each coin flip, once the user chose head or tails.

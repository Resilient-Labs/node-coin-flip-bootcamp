### How it's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

To create this appliction it required a few more steps then what I became accustomed too. After building the HTML, I created two seperate JS Files so that the appilcation could be ran on the server side. In one file I created one function that allows the user to click on the heads or tails button and also cointains two API's which allows the winner or loser to be dispayed in the DOM. The next file consist of the logic behind the randomization of the computer generating Heads or Tails.


### What I learnerd:
This lesson has taught me how to properly use Node.JS to and display my projects on the server side.

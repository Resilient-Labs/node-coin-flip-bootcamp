This coin-flipping game was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is run on the server-side and includes a counter which tells you how many times the coin is heads or tails. I used fs and http modules to build this simple web application. I also used http to create the server and fs to read my html file. In addition to this, I included vanilla E56 jsin a script tag at the bottom of the file.
